# Anti Plugin Modification Plugin
## Also as Anti Worm
[简体中文](readme_cn.md)
This plugin is made to prevent the spread of worm. Preventing plugins from infesting other plugin jars in runtime, but does not actually fix them(just like face masks do).   
Having this plugin installed would prevent the modification and creation of jars inside plugin folder in runtime, which may cause some inconvenience.
